            <p>We're using a custom made algorithm that is based on dog age and weight.</p>
            <p id="facts">Most people think that one dog year equals seven human years. But according to WebMD, your dog’s real age is not that simple:

                Dogs mature more quickly than children in the first couple of years. So the first year of a dog’s life is equal to about 15 human years, rather than seven.

                Size and breed also influence the rate at which a dog ages. Although smaller dogs tend to live longer than larger dogs, they may mature more quickly in the first few years of life. A large dog may mature more slowly at first but already be considered elderly at age 5. Small and toy breeds don’t become “seniors” until around age 10. Medium-size breeds are somewhere in the middle in terms of maturation and life span.</p>
